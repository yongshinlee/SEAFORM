    "# A. Downloading seasonal weather forecasts\n",
    "\n",
    "The atmosphere can be viewed as a chaotic system in which the future state depends sensitively on the initial conditions, i.e. a slight change in the initial conditions can lead to a significant change in the forecast outputs. The fact that estimates of the current state are inaccurate and that numerical models have inadequacies, leads to forecast errors and uncertainty that grow with increasing forecast lead time. Ensemble forecasting aims at capturing this forecast uncertainty by generating an ensemble of several possible scenarios with the same probability of occurrence.
